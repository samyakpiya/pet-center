### Cutting Edge

- useFormStatus() for easy loading state with server actions (in forms)
- useTransition() for Server Actions (Loading State): To get a loading state with server actions outside forms, use useTransition()
- useOptimistic() for Optimistic UI
- flushSync() to force updates synchronously. The normal behavior is that React batches state updates together.
- react-hook-form for performant, flexible and extensible forms
- useFormState() gives the error state to forms without losing progressive enhancements.
